						Kidzibit is a device where people can have indirect physical interaction. Parents can play games with their child, who is on the other side of the world, through the cushion. When the child replies or interacts with the cushion, the feedback on the other cushion may vibrate or have flashing lights appearing on the cushion. The cushion will have voice recording function and memory storage for storing the voice recording that they have received. This product is particularly for family use, such as dad playing games with their sons/daughters around age 2 to 4, when he is out on a business trip. The cushion will be connected to a cell-phone device so they can let the other side know that they are going to respond or having interaction with the cushion by sending a notification first.
					</p>
					<p>
						We wanted to break away from the same communication conventions during long distance calls such as video calls and text messages. We thought about the missing experience of hugging one another or playing games with the people you miss. We hope to add a tangible experience especially for kids who don’t have play time with their parents who are away often.
