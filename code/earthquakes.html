						Introduction
					</h4>
			    	<p>
						We have chosen to create a Earthquake data visualization tool as our interactive visualization project. This project aims at providing analytical value and insight into the potential influence of earthquake activities’ in relationship to population density of cities across the United States of America. With various sets of earthquake data obtained from USGS and US population density data from US Census Bureau, we were able to geographically visualize earthquake activities from March 15 to 21 with “coordinates”, “depth”, “magnitude”, and “time” information on a US map with colour scaled population density.
					</p>
					<h4>
						Target Audience
					</h4>
					<p>
						The scope of this project could potentially be of interest to government leaders, officials, and related departments (eg. Department of Defense) concerned with disaster-relief, response, and management surrounding earthquakes. As a proof of concept to our project, the scope of visualization is currently limited to only within US region. However, the visualization could be potentially and easily be implemented for any regions, countries, continents in the world, as long as data is provided.
					</p>
					<h4>
						The Visualization
					</h4>
					<p>
						With our target audience in mind, we set out to think about the most crucial question about earthquakes that is most relevant to them: where are earthquakes happening that can potentially be very dangerous [high population density]. In order scope down relevancy of the information presented and provide insight, we have decided to provide various interactive tools, including timeline brushing, magnitude range slider, city network/ earthquake toggles, and tooltips. An accurate visualization of population and earthquake coordinates are presented with corresponding visual elements on a US map to provide contextual information. In essence, visual encoding variables such as position, colour, size is used to help create an effective visualization.
