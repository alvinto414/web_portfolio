					Parallel Coordinates + Scatterplot Visualization
				</h3>
				<h4>
					Completion Date: March 2, 2014
				</h4>
				<p>
					This project requires me to create a parallel coordinates and scatterplot visualization that reads data from a comma-separated text file. Each parallel coordinate takes vertical "stripe" as the axis  that holds an individual data variable. Each stripe is the same height, with the minimum data value at the bottom, and the maximum at the top. To start with, all variables are shown.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is combined with a scatterplot that assigns data variables to X, Y, Color, etc. The key feature is brushing between views. That is, selecting data in one view highlights the same data in the other view.This means that individual data points and groups of data points are selectable.
				</p>
				<p>
					I chose to use the d3 JavaScript library for this project because it is versatile and is able to provide me the right tools to develop a visualization. This was my first time using this library, therefore, there was a certain learning curve to it. I researched and studied online tutorials when I was facing challenges. The result was great
